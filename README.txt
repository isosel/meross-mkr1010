The program named code.ino aims to remotly control a connected Outlet plug in order to switch it ON or OFF, check the wiki for more details. 

It has to be incorporated into the SCAO project "Quiet Cook" made by Régis Leruste.

A big thx to Ilias Nafili for his help in understanding internet protocol and servers ♥ ♥ ♥

More improvement coming soon (low power mode and auto-configuration IP) cause the smart plug often change his IP address, it's boring.
